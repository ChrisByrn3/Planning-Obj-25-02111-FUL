`Dear Sir/Madam,

Please accept this as my formal objection to Planning Application 25/02111/FUL.

Name: ${name}
Address: ${address}
Email: ${email}


Formal Objection to Planning Application 25/02111/FUL

Applicant: Barratt & David Wilson Homes North
West
Location: Land at Chester Road, Sandiway.
Proposal: Development of 154 dwellings with access

Date: ${date}

I wish to object to the proposal for the following reasons.

1. Conflict with Local and National Planning Policy

Policies breached:

Cuddington & Sandiway Village Plan: Development should be proportionate to infrastructure, protect heritage, and preserve green space.

NPF paras. 8 & 11: Sustainable development requires balanced social, economic, and environmental factors.

CWAC STRAT1 & STRAT9: Directs major housing to areas with infrastructure and avoids harm to character or environment.


Reason: Scale and location of the proposal are disproportionate to the village‚Äôs infrastructure and will cause permanent loss of green space and heritage setting.


2. Failure to Meet Local Housing Need

Policies breached:

Cuddington & Sandiway Village Plan (Housing Objectives): Calls for a small number of genuinely affordable, smaller homes for young people, first-time buyers, and downsizing older residents.

NPF para. 15: Development should be genuinely plan-led and responsive to local evidence.

CWAC SOC1: Requires housing provision to match identified local needs and tenure mix.


Reason: The scheme is dominated by larger, high-value market housing, with an affordable element below required social rent levels and heavily skewed to shared ownership. This fails to meet the documented local demand for low-cost rental options and smaller homes, directly conflicting with adopted local policy and the NPF.


3. Loss of High-Quality Agricultural Land

Policies breached:

NPF para. 174(b) & 175: Protect the best and most versatile agricultural land.

CWAC ENV3: Safeguard productive farmland for food security.


Reason: The site is actively farmed and forms part of Cheshire‚Äôs agricultural base. Loss is unnecessary when brownfield sites exist (e.g., Northwich market site).


4. Inadequate Health and Education Infrastructure

Policies breached:

NPF para. 20(c) & 34: Development must be supported by adequate services and facilities.

CWAC SOC5 & SOC6: Requires provision for healthcare and education in step with development.


Reason: GP and dental services are already oversubscribed since local surgery closure; schools are at/near capacity. No secured provision in place.


5. Traffic Congestion and Highway Safety Risks

Policies breached:

NPF para. 111: Development should be refused if highway safety issues are unresolved.

CWAC TWH1: Development must not cause unacceptable highway impacts.


Reason: Weaverham Road, School Lane, Dalefords Lane, and A556 already suffer congestion, speeding, and accident risks. Public transport is minimal, making the scheme car-dependent.


6. Environmental and Biodiversity Harm

Policies breached:

NPF para. 179 & 180: Protect and enhance biodiversity and priority habitats.

CWAC ENV4 & ENV5: Protect ancient woodland, wildlife corridors, and hedgerows.


Reason: Adjacent to ancient woodland and The Whitegate Way; loss of habitat and hedgerows would damage biodiversity and local amenity.


7. Impact on Heritage and Conservation Character

Policies breached:

NPF para. 199: Great weight must be given to conserving heritage assets and their setting.

CWAC ENV6: Protect locally important heritage, including work of John Douglas.


Reason: Development is visually and architecturally out of character with the conservation area and fails to respect local historic context.


8. Protected Trees and Green Infrastructure

Policies breached:

Town & Country Planning Act 1990, s.197 & s.210: Duty to protect TPO trees.

CWAC ENV3: Protect important landscape features.


Reason: The site contains or adjoins TPO-protected trees with Root Protection Areas (RPAs) of 12m+, which must not be compromised by building works or garden landscaping.


9. Loss of Amenity and Rural Character

Policies breached:

NPF para. 130: Development must be visually attractive, sympathetic to local character.

Village Plan Objective 2: Preserve semi-rural identity and avoid urban sprawl.


Reason: The proposal extends development beyond the village‚Äôs natural boundaries (A49/A556/Norley Road), leading to coalescence with neighbouring settlements.


10. Construction and Long-Term Pollution

Policies breached:

NPF para. 185: New development should be mitigated against noise and air quality impacts.

CWAC ENV7: Avoid harmful environmental effects during and after construction.


Reason: Prolonged construction noise, dust, traffic, and long-term increase in vehicle emissions will harm residents‚Äô health and wellbeing.



---

Summary:
This proposal breaches multiple provisions of the NPF Dec 2024, the CWAC Local Plan, and the Cuddington & Sandiway Village Plan. It is not plan-led, fails to meet identified housing needs, undermines heritage and biodiversity, places unacceptable strain on infrastructure, and creates unresolved highway safety risks. Sustainable, policy-compliant alternatives exist, making this location inappropriate for development.
